# RedLabs App Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implement a RedLabs app as a Next.js route that provides a mock UI for managing VLESS VPN servers and simulating Telegram-based authentication. The UI will have separate views for regular users (VPN connection and server selection) and admin users (server management). All components will use modern, minimalist styling with clean typography, spacing, and layout. No external icon libraries or image services (except for necessary placeholders) will be used.

## New Files and Directories
- **New Folder:**  
  `src/components/redlabs/`  
  Contains all custom RedLabs components.

- **New Files:**  
  - `src/app/redlabs/page.tsx` – Main RedLabs dashboard page.  
  - `src/components/redlabs/ConnectionStatus.tsx` – Displays current VPN connection status, with "Connect"/"Disconnect" buttons and error messages.  
  - `src/components/redlabs/ServerCard.tsx` – Renders individual VLESS server details (server name, location, address, port, status) using card-style layout and a "Connect" button.  
  - `src/components/redlabs/ServerList.tsx` – Iterates over mock data and renders a grid/list of ServerCard components.  
  - `src/components/redlabs/TelegramLoginModal.tsx` – Implements a modal dialog (using shadcn/ui's Dialog) to simulate Telegram authentication with input fields for credentials and error handling.  
  - `src/components/redlabs/AdminPanel.tsx` – Provides admin-only UI to manage VPN server details (add/edit/remove entries) using form components with validation.  
  - (Optional) `src/components/redlabs/AccessControl.tsx` – Manages role-based access, toggling between user and admin views.

## Modified Files
- **README.md:** Update with feature descriptions, instructions for running the RedLabs app, and notes about future integration (Telegram and VLESS server API endpoints).
- **next.config.ts:** Add placeholders to load environment variables (e.g., TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_APP_ID, TELEGRAM_APP_HASH, VLESS_SERVER_CONFIG) for future development.
- **eslint.config.mjs & tsconfig.json:** Verify that new path aliases or TypeScript interfaces are integrated without conflicts.

## Detailed Component Integration
- **src/app/redlabs/page.tsx:**  
  - Import and render the navigation (tabs for "My VPN" and "Admin Panel"), ConnectionStatus, ServerList, and conditionally TelegramLoginModal/AdminPanel based on authentication state.  
  - Use React hooks (useState) to simulate authentication (isAuthenticated, isAdmin) and VPN connection status.  
  - Implement error boundaries to catch component errors and show fallback UI.

- **src/components/redlabs/ConnectionStatus.tsx:**  
  - Create a card-style component displaying connection status with "Connected" or "Disconnected" messages.  
  - Include styled buttons for "Connect" and "Disconnect" actions, using try–catch for simulated connection errors.

- **src/components/redlabs/ServerCard.tsx:**  
  - Accept props for server details; if props are missing, use default values.  
  - Layout information in a clean, spaced card format with a button for connecting to the server.

- **src/components/redlabs/ServerList.tsx:**  
  - Define a mock JSON array of server data and map over it to render ServerCard components.  
  - Display an appropriate message if no server data exists.

- **src/components/redlabs/TelegramLoginModal.tsx:**  
  - Use shadcn/ui's Dialog component to render a modal with input fields for Telegram Bot credentials.  
  - Include clear form labels and error handling (e.g., empty field errors) with modern typography and spacing.

- **src/components/redlabs/AdminPanel.tsx:**  
  - Render form components to simulate server management (add/edit/remove server entries).  
  - Validate inputs and display error messages for invalid data, ensuring a smooth UX for admin tasks.

## UI/UX Considerations
- Use a modern, minimalist design leveraging shadcn/ui components along with custom CSS in `globals.css`.
- All modals, forms, and cards will have consistent spacing, readable fonts, and a clean layout.
- Responsive design considerations: Layout adjusts gracefully on mobile and desktop.
- Provide clear user feedback for errors or system state changes.

## Error Handling and Best Practices
- Validate all component props using TypeScript interfaces.
- Use try–catch blocks around simulated async operations (e.g., connection attempts) to display user-friendly error messages.
- Ensure accessibility by adding appropriate alt text for any images (using placeholder image URLs only if necessary) and semantic HTML tags.
- Document behavior in comments and update README with integration details for future APIs.

## Environment Variables
- Reference environment variables in `next.config.ts` for TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_APP_ID, and VLESS_SERVER_CONFIG.
- Use default/mock values in development and provide clear instructions in README for production configuration.

## Testing
- Perform manual UI testing in the browser to validate:
  - Navigation between "My VPN" and "Admin Panel" views.
  - Modal open/close behavior for Telegram login.
  - Simulated server connect/disconnect functionality with error messages.
- Validate component prop types and simulate error conditions using React state.

## Summary
- A new RedLabs page is created at `src/app/redlabs/page.tsx` to integrate VPN management with Telegram auth.
- New components (ConnectionStatus, ServerCard, ServerList, TelegramLoginModal, AdminPanel) are added under `src/components/redlabs/`.
- The UI is designed with modern typography, spacing, and a minimalist layout without external icon libraries.
- Environment variables and error handling are set up with TypeScript best practices for future integrations.
- The plan includes manual testing steps and future enhancement notes for API integration and persistent authentication.


 After the plan approval, I will Breakdown the plan into logical steps and create a tracker (TODO.md) to track the execution of steps in the plan. I will overwrite this file every time to update the completed steps.
